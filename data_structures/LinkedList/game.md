# The Game of Black JACK that is implemented here: These rules are taken from Learn C++ by making games 
  * A single player plays against the dealer
  * The deck contains an infinite supply of cards
  * The goal of the game is to assemble a hand whose value is as close to 21 as possible, without going over
  * Whoever gets closest to 21 without going over wins the hand
  * Aces are worth either 1 or 11 points, at the players choice
  * Face cards are worth 10 points
  * All other cards are worth a number of points equal to their numerical value. Suits are irrelevant
  * The player gets at least two cards. After that, s/he can either ask to be 'hit' with another card or decide to stay with his current hand
  * The player receives as many cards as s/he wants, until s/he is ready to stay with the current hand or the hands total value reaches 21 or more
  * The dealer is forced to stay on any hand worth 17 or more, and to hit on 16 and under
